# Predicting-Ames-house-prices

We will be using Ames housing data set to train and tune our model to predict the price of a house given house features
We'll start off with using the Ames Housing dataset.

# Data cleaning

We will clean and prepare our data by handling missing values , outliers and repeated entries

# Data preprocessing

Once data is clean we will move to data preprocessing stage where we will do feature scaling and standardization of data

# Splitting and training data

we will split our data into training data ,test data and validation data set and train our model with cross validation

# Hyperparameter tuning

According to our cross validation results we will tune model hyperparameters and again test the output of our model

# Final testing

We will test the output / accuracy of our model on a validation dataset for the last time

# Model deployment

After final testing we will deploy our model
